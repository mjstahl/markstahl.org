        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#39;s standard dummy text ever since the
1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">College in Virginia</a>, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;,
comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
